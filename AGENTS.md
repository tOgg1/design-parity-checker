RULE 1 – ABSOLUTE (DO NOT EVER VIOLATE THIS)

You may NOT delete any file or directory unless I explicitly give the exact command **in this session**.

- This includes files you just created (tests, tmp files, scripts, etc.).
- You do not get to decide that something is “safe” to remove.
- If you think something should be removed, stop and ask. You must receive clear written approval **before** any deletion command is even proposed.

Treat “never delete files without permission” as a hard invariant.

---

### IRREVERSIBLE GIT & FILESYSTEM ACTIONS

Absolutely forbidden unless I give the **exact command and explicit approval** in the same message:

- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`
- `rm -rf`
- Any command that can delete or overwrite code/data

Rules:

1. If you are not 100% sure what a command will delete, do not propose or run it. Ask first.
2. Prefer safe tools: `git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups, etc.
3. After approval, restate the command verbatim, list what it will affect, and wait for confirmation.
4. When a destructive command is run, record in your response:
   - The exact user text authorizing it
   - The command run
   - When you ran it

If that audit trail is missing, then you must act as if the operation never happened.


---

### Code Editing Discipline

- Do **not** run scripts that bulk-modify code (codemods, invented one-off scripts, giant `sed`/regex refactors).
- Large mechanical changes: break into smaller, explicit edits and review diffs.
- Subtle/complex changes: edit by hand, file-by-file, with careful reasoning.

- The bar for adding files is very high.

### Third-Party Libraries

When unsure of an API, look up current docs (late-2025) rather than guessing.

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

Agent Mail is already available as an MCP server; do not treat it as a CLI you must shell out to.

What it gives:

- Identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads.
- Advisory file reservations (leases) to avoid agents clobbering each other.
- Persistent artifacts in git (human-auditable).

Core patterns:

1. **Same repo**
   - Register identity:
     - `ensure_project` then `register_agent` with the repo’s absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before editing:
     - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`.
   - Communicate:
     - `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`.
     - `fetch_inbox`, then `acknowledge_message`.
   - Fast reads:
     - `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20`.
     - `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Optional:
     - Set `AGENT_NAME` so the pre-commit guard can block conflicting commits.
     - `WORKTREES_ENABLED=1` and `AGENT_MAIL_GUARD_MODE=warn` during trials.
     - Check hooks with `mcp-agent-mail guard status .` and identity with `mcp-agent-mail mail status .`.

2. **Multiple repos in one product**
   - Option A: Same `project_key` for all; use specific reservations (`frontend/**`, `backend/**`).
   - Option B: Different projects linked via:
     - `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact` / `respond_contact`.
     - Use a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) for cross-repo threads.

Macros vs granular:

- Prefer macros when speed is more important than fine-grained control:
  - `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need explicit behavior.

Product bus:

- Create/ensure product: `mcp-agent-mail products ensure MyProduct --name "My Product"`.
- Link repo: `mcp-agent-mail products link MyProduct .`.
- Inspect: `mcp-agent-mail products status MyProduct`.
- Search: `mcp-agent-mail products search MyProduct "bd-123 OR \"release plan\"" --limit 50`.
- Product inbox: `mcp-agent-mail products inbox MyProduct YourAgent --limit 50 --urgent-only --include-bodies`.
- Summaries: `mcp-agent-mail products summarize-thread MyProduct "bd-123" --per-thread-limit 100 --no-llm`.

Server-side tools (for orchestrators) include:

- `ensure_product(product_key|name)`
- `products_link(product_key, project_key)`
- `resource://product/{key}`
- `search_messages_product(product_key, query, limit=20)`

Common pitfalls:

- “from_agent not registered” → call `register_agent` with correct `project_key`.
- `FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT` → adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation.
- Auth issues with JWT+JWKS → bearer token with `kid` matching server JWKS; static bearer only when JWT disabled.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

All issue tracking goes through **bd**. No other TODO systems.

Key invariants:

- `.beads/` is authoritative state and **must always be committed** with code changes.
- Do not edit `.beads/*.jsonl` directly; only via `bd`.

### Basics

Check ready work:

```bash
bd ready --json
```

Create issues:

```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

Update:

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

Complete:

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

Types:

- `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `epic`, `chore`

Priorities:

- `0` critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` high
- `2` medium (default)
- `3` low
- `4` backlog

Agent workflow:

1. `bd ready` to find unblocked work.
2. Claim: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`.
3. Implement + test.
4. If you discover new work, create a new bead with `discovered-from:<parent-id>`.
5. Close when done.
6. Commit `.beads/` in the same commit as code changes.

Auto-sync:

- bd exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (debounced).
- It imports from JSONL when newer (e.g. after `git pull`).

Never:

- Use markdown TODO lists.
- Use other trackers.
- Duplicate tracking.

### Using bv as an AI Sidecar

`bv` is a terminal UI + analysis layer for `.beads/beads.jsonl`. It precomputes graph metrics so you don’t have to.

Useful robot commands:

- `bv --robot-help` – overview
- `bv --robot-insights` – graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles)
- `bv --robot-plan` – parallelizable execution plan with unblocks info
- `bv --robot-priority` – priority suggestions with reasoning
- `bv --robot-recipes` – list recipes; apply via `bv --recipe <name>`
- `bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date>` – JSON diff of issue changes

Use `bv` instead of rolling your own dependency graph logic.

### Morph Warp Grep — AI-Powered Code Search

Use `warpgrep_codebase_search` for “how does X work?” discovery across the codebase.

When to use:

- You don’t know where something lives.
- You want data flow across multiple files (API → service → schema → types).
- You want all touchpoints of a cross-cutting concern (e.g., moderation, billing).

Example:

```
warpgrep_codebase_search(
  repoPath: "/data/projects/communitai",
  query: "How is the L3 Guardian appeals system implemented?"
)
```

Warp Grep:

- Expands a natural-language query to multiple search patterns.
- Runs targeted greps, reads code, follows imports, then returns concise snippets with line numbers.
- Reduces token usage by returning only relevant slices, not entire files.

When **not** to use Warp Grep:

- You already know the function/identifier name; use `rg`.
- You know the exact file; just open it.
- You only need a yes/no existence check.

Comparison:

| Scenario | Tool |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| “How is auth session validated?” | warp_grep |
| “Where is `handleSubmit` defined?” | `rg` |
| “Replace `var` with `let`” | `ast-grep` |

### cass — Cross-Agent Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) so we can reuse solved problems.

Rules:

- Never run bare `cass` (TUI). Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

Examples:

```bash
cass health
cass search "authentication error" --robot --limit 5
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json
cass capabilities --json
cass robot-docs guide
```

Tips:

- Use `--fields minimal` for lean output.
- Filter by agent with `--agent`.
- Use `--days N` to limit to recent history.

stdout is data-only, stderr is diagnostics; exit code 0 means success.

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.
